This is an assignment for my Data Structures class.

Some notes:
  - Sometimes the number of rounds is greater than the limit, this happens when there are multiple "wars" at the end of the game.
  - As per the rules laid out in the google doc, when a deck is empty, the game is over. This means that if the players are in a "war", and one of the players does not have the four cards necessary for the war, the game is over. Also, if a player has only one card left, the game should end, as playing that card would empty their deck. I have never seen war played this way, but I am following the given specifications.
